# CompassProject-Waypoint
A group project to learn app development and have some fun created by 
@Sakomm,@alexc114,@Persepolis7

The goal of this project was to create an app that can be used as a sort of waypoint detection. The user will set a waypoint(GPS Coordinates)at their location and be free to move around our "Compass" will always point you in the right direction to the waypoint you set. Multiple waypoints can be set in the app. 

Done using the phones internal Magnetometer and GPS as well as the usage of the google maps API
